1. What is the DOM? 
    A.
        DOM is the way manipulated stuff is displayed in the browser using nodes. everything is an object.


2. What is an event?
    A.
        The Event interface. An interface action like the mouseEvent: click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown. Events the user can trigger: using the mouse wheel to scroll.


3. What is an event listener?
    A.
        The EventListener interface allows ability to target elements for desired manipulation

        buttonElement.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
            alert('Element clicked through function!');
        });

        element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);


4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
    A.
        Things like querySelectorAll() and getElementsByTagName() aren’t JavaScript methods, they’re browser APIs that let you access DOM elements. You can then manipulate them with JavaScript.

        The Array.from() method creates a new array from an existing one, or from an array-like object (which is what a NodeList is).

        So to be able to use an array method to cycle through data.

        var btns = document.querySelectorAll('button');
        var btnsArr = Array.from(btns);


5. What is a component?
    A.
        Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function.

        Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.


        class component
            class Car extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                }
            }
    ******************************************
        function component
            function Car() {
                return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
            }
